# node-python

A super small Docker image which provides both Python and Node binaries. The image is only 5 MB and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images.

## Why?

If you are using webpack to package your frontend code and Django as a backend, neither the Python or Node images meet your needs. This image packages both dependencies in a single image.
